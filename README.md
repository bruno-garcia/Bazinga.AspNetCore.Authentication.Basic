Basic Authentication for Microsoft ASP.NET Core Security

Microsoft doesn't ship a Basic Authentication package with ASP.NET Core Security for a good reason.
While that doesn't stop us needing such implementation for testing, this is not advised for production systems due to the many pitfalls and insecurities.

Sample usages, with hard-coded credentials:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddMvc();
    services.AddAuthentication()
        .AddBasicAuthentication(credentials => 
            Task.FromResult(
                credentials.username == "myUsername" 
                && credentials.password == "myPassword"));
}
```

Or by defining a service to register. Allowing your validator to take dependencies through Dependency Injection:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddAuthorization()
        .AddBasicAuthentication<DatabaseBasicCredentialVerifier>();
}

// With your own validator
public class DatabaseBasicCredentialVerifier : IBasicCredentialVerifier
{
    private readonly IUserRepository _db;
    
    public DatabaseBasicCredentialVerifier(IUserRepository db) => _db = db;

    public Task<bool> Authenticate(string username, string password)
    {
        return _db.IsValidAsync(username, password);
    }
}
```

And finally, since ASP.NET Core 2.0, the single middeware for authentication:

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    app.UseAuthentication();
    app.AddMvc();
}
```
